The main structures that can be visualized on a fundus photo are the central and peripheral retina, optic disc and macula. Fundus photography can be performed with coloured filters, or with specialized dyes including fluorescein and indocyanine green. For this purpose the pupil is dilated with eye drops and a special camera called a fundus camera is used to focus on the fundus.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve and cause vision loss. The most common type is open-angle glaucoma, in which the drainage angle for fluid within the eye remains open, with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Opaque specks may occur in the lens in glaucoma, known as glaukomflecken.</p>

Peripheral vision may begin to decrease, followed by central vision, resulting in blindness if not treated. As it is painless and does not have acute attacks, thus the lack of clear symptoms make screening via regular eye check-ups important. The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss, and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination.</p>
                <p class="lead">Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, very high intraocular pressure (>30 mmHg), and nausea. Person suffers from vision loss once the person is affected by it. Ocular hypertension (increased pressure within the eye) is the most important risk factor in most glaucomas.</p></div>

The presence of a few small ("hard") drusen is normal with advancing age, and most people over 40 have some hard drusen. However, the presence of larger and more numerous drusen in the macula is a common early sign of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</p>

It is common in older people. The severity is divided into early, intermediate, and late types. The late type is additionally divided into "dry" and "wet" forms with the dry form making up 90% of cases. Genetic factors and smoking are also one of the reasons that causes person to have AMD.</p>
                    <p class="lead">There are not many symptoms in early stages but as time passes some people experience a gradual worsening of vision that may affect one or both eyes. While it does not result in complete blindness, loss of central vision can make it hard to recognize faces, drive, read, or perform other activities of daily life. Distorted vision in the form of metamorphopsia, in which a grid of straight lines appears wavy and parts of the grid may appear blank. There may also be central scotomas, shadows or missing areas of vision.</p>

As well as in wet macular degeneration, CNV can also occur frequently with the rare genetic disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum and rarely with the more common optic disc drusen. CNV has also been associated with extreme myopia or malignant myopic degeneration, where in choroidal neovascularization occurs primarily in the presence of cracks within the retinal (specifically) macular tissue known as lacquer cracks.</p>
